# percona-openshift
Set of scripts to run Percona software in OpenShift / Kubernetes / Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine

## MySQL Passwords
Before deployments you need to create passwords (secrets) which will be used to access Percona Server / Percona XtraDB Cluster.
We provide file https://github.com/Percona-Lab/percona-openshift/blob/master/deploy/secret.yaml as an example. **Please use your own secure passwords!**

Use `base64` to encode a password for `secret.yaml` : `echo -n 'securepassword' | base64`.
Used `base64 -d` to decode a password from `secret.yaml` : `echo YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk | base64 -d`


## Considerations
The proposed depoyments were tested on Kubernetes 1.9 / OpenShift Origin 3.9. The earlier versions may not work.

The deployments assume you have a default `StorageClass` which will provide Persistent Volumes. If not, you need to create `PersistentVolume` manually.
